Ideas for improvement:
1. After printing "Game saved", change don't print "Press S to save your game". It feels odd.
2. Add an option which allows users to go back while they're in the set-up process, where they enter their names, board dims, etc.
3. **Make sure valid entries are checked everywhere**
4. See if you could add an option through which ctrl+s would be the save command
5. Design a logo :)
6. Implement the game using graphics libraries
7. Write a Readme.md for GitHub
8. Write a "help" section for the game
9. If AI is somehow successfuly implemented, allow different levels of difficulty
10. Add "shadows" for each pawn, when it is its turn. It should make the game way more intuitive.
I'm guessing the key to implementing that, must be successfully changing the color of one single character in the board.
11. Allow change of move type. A player might regret their choice, afterall.
12. Add dark mode (even addaptive dark, maybe? :)))
13. Make the game's ending a bit happier for the winner
14. Add sounds for each move
15. Tidy up the code even further
16. Organise the files
